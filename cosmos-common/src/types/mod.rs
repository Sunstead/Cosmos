//! Types shared between `cosmos-agent` and the desktop app.
//!
//! Every type here derives `ts_rs::TS` and exports to `app/src/generated/`.
//! Run `cargo test -p cosmos-common` to regenerate the TypeScript bindings —
//! that directory is gitignored, so a fresh clone has none until you do.
//!
//! Note `export_to` is resolved against `cosmos-common/bindings/`, not against
//! the source file, so every module here uses the identical path string.
//!
//! ## `#[ts(type = "number")]` on 64-bit integers
//!
//! ts-rs maps `u64`/`i64` to TypeScript `bigint`, but serde writes them as
//! plain JSON numbers and `JSON.parse` produces `number` — so the unannotated
//! binding would be a type that never matches the value at runtime. Every
//! 64-bit field here is a byte count, a unix timestamp or a counter, all of
//! which sit far below `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (9 PB, in the case of bytes),
//! so `number` is both accurate and what the JSON actually contains.
